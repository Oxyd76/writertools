=Writer's Tools User Guide Notes=

==Changing the Default Browser==

The Writer's Tools extension uses Firefox browser, and it expects to find it in the Program Files folder (on Windows). If you are using another browser or a non-US version of Windows, you have to update the default browser path. To do this, launch !OpenOffice.org and choose _Tools -> Macros -> Organize Macros -> !OpenOffice.org Basic_. Select then the !LookupTool macro as shown in the figure below and press the Edit button:

Replace all occurrences of the `"C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe"` string with the correct path, for example:

`"C:\Program Files\Opera\opera.exe"` or `"C:\Programmer\Opera\opera.exe"`

Save the changes, and you are done.


==Automating the Email Backup tool==

Using the Email Backup command, you can email a backup copy of the current document to a specified email address. If you are using a specific email address for all your backups, you might want to add it to the command, so you don't have to type it every single time. To do this, launch !OpenOffice.org and choose _Tools -> Macros -> Organize Macros -> !OpenOffice.org Basic_. Select then the EMailBackup macro and press the Edit button. Locate the following line `MailAddress=InputBox("Email address")` and replace the `InputBox("Email address")` part with your actual email address, for example, `MailAddress="user@email.org"`.
