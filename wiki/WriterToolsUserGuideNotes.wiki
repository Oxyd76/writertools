==Automating the Email Backup tool==

Using the Email Backup command, you can email a backup copy of the current document to a specified email address. If you are using a specific email address for all your backups, you might want to add it to the command, so you don't have to type it every single time. To do this, launch !OpenOffice.org and choose _Tools -> Macros -> Organize Macros -> !OpenOffice.org Basic_. Select then the EMailBackup macro and press the Edit button. Locate the following line `MailAddress=InputBox("Email address")` and replace the `InputBox("Email address")` part with your actual email address, for example, `MailAddress="user@email.org"`.
